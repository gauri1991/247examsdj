## üîë Important Technical Details

### Payment Gateway Architecture:
```python
# Factory pattern for gateway selection
gateway = PaymentGatewayFactory.get_gateway_for_user(user, user_country)
result = gateway.create_order(user, plan, discount_code)
```

### Invoice Generation:
```python
# Professional PDF generation
generator = InvoiceGenerator()
pdf_buffer = generator.generate_invoice(payment)
filepath = generator.save_invoice(payment)
```

### Webhook Processing:
```python
# Secure webhook handling
success, message = gateway.process_webhook(payload, signature)
```

### Configuration Management:
```python
# Environment-based configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'test_key')
gateway_name = PaymentConfig.get_active_gateway(user_country)
```
