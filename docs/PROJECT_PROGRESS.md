- Professional, responsive layouts

#### Key Class Conversions:
```css
/* Before (Broken with CDN) */
.btn-primary { @apply bg-blue-600 text-white ... }
.form-input { @apply border border-gray-300 ... }

/* After (CDN Compatible) */
.btn-primary: inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 border border-transparent text-sm font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-500

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Framework Strategy
**Challenge**: Tailwind CDN doesn't support `@apply` directives  
**Solution**: Systematic conversion to direct utility classes

#### Conversion Pattern:
1. **Identify** all custom CSS classes using `@apply`
2. **Replace** with full Tailwind utility class strings
3. **Maintain** design consistency across templates
4. **Add** fallback CSS for JavaScript compatibility

### Form System Architecture
- **Consistent Labels**: `block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-1`
- **Input Fields**: `block w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm placeholder-gray-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 sm:text-sm`
- **Buttons**: Standardized primary/secondary button classes
- **Help Text**: `mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500`

### JavaScript Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate functions for each feature
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **DOM Validation**: Element existence checks
- **Event Management**: Proper listener registration
