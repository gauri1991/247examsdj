## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
```python
# PageReviewStatus: Track page-level status
class PageReviewStatus(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('pending', 'Pending Review'),
        ('in_progress', 'In Progress'), 
        ('completed', 'Completed'),
        ('no_questions', 'No Questions'),
        ('pending_unsupported', 'Pending - Unsupported Type'),
        ('skipped', 'Skipped'),
        ('error', 'Error'),
    ]

# SavedRegion: Store region-level data
class SavedRegion(models.Model):
    REGION_STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('detected', 'Detected'),
        ('completed', 'Questions Extracted'),
        ('unsupported', 'Unsupported Type'),
        ('no_questions', 'No Questions'),
        ('error', 'Processing Error'),
    ]
```

### Key API Endpoints
- `/api/mark-page-no-questions/` - Mark page as having no questions
- `/api/mark-page-for-later/` - Mark page for later with comments
- `/api/mark-regions-unsupported/` - Mark selected regions as unsupported
- `/api/saved-regions/` - Get/manage saved regions
- `/api/delete-region/` - Delete saved regions
- `/api/delete-document/` - Delete entire document with warnings

### Status Calculation Logic
```python
def _calculate_document_processing_status(document):
    """Calculate real processing status based on page review progress"""
    # Returns: {'display': str, 'color': str, 'description': str}
    # Colors: 'green' (complete), 'orange' (unsupported), 'blue' (in_progress), 'yellow' (not_started)
```

### Coordinate Scaling Solution
Fixed scaling issues between actual PDF coordinates and display coordinates:
```javascript
// Convert actual coordinates to display coordinates
const scaleX = displayWidth / actualWidth;
const scaleY = displayHeight / actualHeight;
```
